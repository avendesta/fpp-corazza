  because instance variables of member inner class can be accessed from the outer class, but a local inner class is not used outside its outer class.
B. (iii)
  For this case anonymous inner class is suitable because you don't need to create Auxillary method, which is useless if the method is used only few times.
C. (i)
  - Loop creates instances of the inner class each time it is created if the inner class is a local inner class,
     so local inner classes are not good; Member classes do not have such problem.
